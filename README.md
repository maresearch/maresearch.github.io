# Ma group website

Template:  [Hugo Research Group Theme](https://github.com/wowchemy/starter-hugo-research-group)

The pages for the group members are generated from the `content/authors` directory.
Each member has a directory (usually) named after their first name.
The directory contains an `_index.md` file containing the member's data.

To update, edit the following files according to the template:
- `config`
- `.github/workflows`
- `go.mod`
